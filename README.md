Geospatial and Temporal Data Analysis on the New York City Taxi Trip Data

In March of 2014, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission shared an infographic on its Twitter account, @nyctaxi, that showed the number of taxis on the road and the fraction of those taxis that was occupied at any given time. Sure enough, there was a noticeable dip of taxis on the road from 4 to 6 PM, and two-thirds of the taxis that were driving were occupied.
This tweet caught the eye of self-described urbanist, mapmaker, and data junkie Chris Whong, who sent a tweet to the @nyctaxi account to find out if the data it used in its infographic was publicly available. The taxi commission replied that he could have the data if he filed a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request and provided the commission with hard drives that they could copy the data on to. PDF form, buying two new 500 GB hard drives, and waiting two business days, Chris had access to all of the data on taxi rides from January 1st through December 31st 2013. Even better, he posted all of the fare data online, where it has been used as the basis for a number of beautiful visualizations of transportation in New York City.

One statistic that is important to understanding the economics of taxis is utilization: the fraction of time that a cab is on the road and is occupied by one or more passen‐ gers. One factor that impacts utilization is the passenger’s destination: a cab that drops off passengers near Union Square at midday is much more likely to find its next fare in just a minute or two, whereas a cab that drops someone off at 2 AM on Staten Island may have to drive all the way back to Manhattan before it find its next fare. We’d like to quantify these effects and find out the average time it takes for a cab to find its next fare as a function of the borough in which it dropped its passengers off—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, or none of the above (e.g., if it dropped the passenger off somewhere outside of the city, like Newark Inter‐ national Airport).

To carry out this analysis, we need to deal with two types that data that come up all the time: temporal data, such as dates and times, and geospatial information, like points of longitude and latitude and spatial boundaries. In this chapter, we’re going to demonstrate how to use Scala and Spark to work with these data types.
